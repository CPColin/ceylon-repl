# Ceylon-repl

This is an attempt to write a REPL (a read-evaluate-print loop) for Ceylon in Ceylon. The ultimate
goal is to be able to take a piece of Ceylon code and interpret it, without having to compile it.

Thanks to _[Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)_ for giving me practice.
See my `MonkeyInterpreter` repo for my implementation of that book.
